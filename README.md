<p>hi welcome to my devesto client</p>
<p>just click the zip file named "Roblox-2007-Devesto-Client" and click view raw to download the client (same thing with all the other zips)</p>
<p>the ToolboxModels file contains some models to use</p>
<p>some commands:</p>
<p>game.Players:CreateLocalPlayer(0) creates your player (you cant move the camera easily after doing this, be warned ig)</p>
<p>game.Players.LocalPlayer loads your character (do this command after the one listed above)</p>
<p>enjoy :D</p>
